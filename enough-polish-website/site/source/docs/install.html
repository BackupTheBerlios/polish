	<%index %>
	<p>For installing J2ME Polish <a href="../download.html">download</a> the
	latest release and start the installation either by double-clicking the file or
	by calling &quot;java -jar j2mepolish-<%= PolishVersion %>.jar&quot; from the command-line.
	It is recommended to install J2ME Polish into a project-folder of your workspace,
	e.g. &quot;$HOME/workspace/j2mepolish&quot;.
	<br/>
	The installer of J2ME Polish contains a sample MIDlet application with
	two different designs. This application is optimized for Nokia Series
	60 devices, so it is recommended to have such an emulator installed. The
	Nokia emulator can be retrieved from <a href="http://forum.nokia.com">http://forum.nokia.com</a>.
	<br/>
	To build the sample application, run the included build.xml from your
	favorite Java IDE or call &quot;ant&quot; from the command-line. Call
	&quot;ant test j2mepolish&quot; to skip the obfuscation and to enable the
	logging of the sample application.
	</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements for Installing J2ME Polish</h2>
<p>
To use J2ME Polish, following components need to be installed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Java 2 Standard Edition SDK 1.4  or higher, 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
	</li>
	<li>Java Wireless Toolkit, 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/j2mewtoolkit/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/j2mewtoolkit/index.html</a>
	</li>
	<li>Favorite IDE, for example Eclipse 3.0, 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>Ant 1.5 or higher, if not already integrated in the IDE, 
	<a href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>Optionally device emulators, e.g. the Nokia J2ME emulator, 
	<a href="http://forum.nokia.com">http://forum.nokia.com</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="updating">Updating J2ME Polish</h2>
<p>
When you want to update an existing installation, you do not need
to re-install the whole package. For saving bandwidth you can download
just the update-package. This package just containts the two JAR-files
enough-j2mepolish-build.jar and enough-j2mepolish-client.jar which need
to be copied into the &quot;import&quot;-folder of your installation.
</p>
<h2 id="integration">Integrating J2ME Polish into Eclipse</h2>
<p>
To integrate J2ME Polish into Eclipse it is best to install J2ME Polish 
(with the included sample application) into a new folder in your workspace 
called &quot;myproject&quot; (or any other name). 
Then start Eclipse and create a new project called &quot;myproject&quot;. 
Eclipse then automatically integrates all source-files and sets the classpath. 
You should find the sample application now in the Package-Explorer (package de.enough.polish.example). 
</p><p>
If the sources have not been integrated automatically, set the source-directory of the project to the &quot;src&quot; directory: Select &quot;Project&quot; -> &quot;Properties...&quot; -> &quot;Java Build Path&quot; -> &quot;Source&quot; and add the source-folder &quot;src&quot; there.
</p><r>
When the classpath was not set correctly, please include the following jar-files from the 
&quot;import&quot; folder to your classpath: 
<br/>import/midp2.jar, import/enough-j2mepolish-client.jar, import/mmapi.jar, import/nokia-ui.jar, import/wmapi.jar.
<br/>Actually only the first two libraries are needed for the sample application, but when the others
are included, future enhancements are easier to accomplish.
</p><p>
Optionally you can change the build-settings by
modifying the file &quot;build.xml&quot; (which is located in the root of your project).
<br/>For example you can change the deviceRequirements if you want to. 
The example is optimized to Nokia Series 60 devices. 
</p><p>
You can now create the JAR and JAD files by right-clicking the build.xml file, selecting &quot;Run Ant&quot; and running Ant in the next dialog. 
You will find the JAR and JAD files then in the &quot;dist&quot; folder of the project.
If you want to access them from within Eclipse, you might need to refresh your project:
<br/>Right-click the project and select &quot;Refresh&quot;.
</p><p>
If the &quot;Run Ant...&quot; command is not shown, select the &quot;build.xml&quot; file, then open the Menu &quot;Run&quot; and select &quot;External Tools&quot; -&gt; &quot;Run as&quot; -&gt; &quot;Ant Build&quot;.
</p><p>
After you have installed J2ME Polish, you will find following structure in your project (assuming that your project is called &quot;myproject&quot; and your workspace &quot;workspace&quot;):
</p>
<table class="borderedTable"  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
	<tr><th>Folder / File&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;</th></tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject</td>
	 <td>The applications project</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/build.xml</td>
	 <td>The controller of the build process</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/devices.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of J2ME devices (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/vendors.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of J2ME device vendors (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/groups.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of device groups (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/apis.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of some common J2ME libraries (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/resources</td>
	 <td>Folder for all resources and design descriptions of the project</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/resources/polish.css</td>
	 <td>Basic design description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/import</td>
	 <td>Needed APIs</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/build</td>
	 <td>Temporary build folder, will be created automatically. Should not be shared in CVS and similar systems.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/dist</td>
	 <td>Folder for the ready-to-deploy applications. It will be created automatically. Should not be shared in CVS and similar systems.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
Tip: You don't need the files &quot;devices.xml&quot;, &quot;vendors.xml&quot;, &quot;groups.xml&quot; and &quot;apis.xml&quot;, since they are also contained in the jar-file &quot;enough-j2mepolish-build.jar&quot;. If you don't want to change them, you can delete them.
</p>

<h2 id="jbuilder">Integrating J2ME Polish into Borland's JBuilder</h2>
<p>
To integrate J2ME Polish into JBuilder it is best to install J2ME Polish (with the included sample application) into a new folder in your workspace called &quot;myproject&quot; (or any other name). Then start JBuilder and create a new project called &quot;myproject&quot;. 
</p><p>
In the project-dialog select the appropriate path and confirm the &quot;src&quot; folder as the main source-folder. Switch to the &quot;Required Libraries&quot; tab and select &quot;Add...&quot; and then &quot;New...&quot;. Enter &quot;MIDP-Development&quot; or similar as the name of the library and add the files &quot;enough-j2mepolish-client.jar&quot;, &quot;midp-2.jar&quot;, &quot;mmapi.jar&quot;, &quot;wmapi.jar&quot; and &quot;nokia-ui.jar&quot; to the library path. 
</p><p>
Note: only the &quot;midp-2.jar&quot; is actually needed by the sample application, but if you later want to explore the full possibilities of J2ME Polish you already have all important libraries included.
</p><p>
Now create the new project.
</p><p>
After the project has been created, you need to integrate the provided &quot;build.xml&quot; file: Select &quot;Wizard&quot; -&gt; &quot;Ant&quot; -&gt; &quot;Add...&quot; and select the file &quot;build.xml&quot; in the project-root. Now the &quot;build.xml&quot; is shown in the project-view. Important: you need to deactivate the Borland-compiler for building the actual applications: Right-click the &quot;build.xml&quot; file, select &quot;Properties...&quot; and de-select the &quot;Use Borland Java compiler&quot; check box. 
</p><p>
You can now build the sample application by right-clicking the &quot;build.xml&quot; file and selecting &quot;Make&quot;.
You will find the created J2ME application files in the &quot;dist&quot; folder of your project, after you have switched to the &quot;File Browser&quot; view.
</p>

<h2 id="netbeans">Integrating J2ME Polish with NetBeans</h2>
<p>For integrating J2ME Polish with NetBeans mount the directory into which you have
installed J2ME Polish, right-click the &quot;build.xml&quot; file and choose &quot;Execute&quot;.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Create a New Project</b>: Go to &quot;Project&quot; -&gt; &quot;Project Manager&quot; 
	and select &quot;New...&quot; and call the new project &quot;j2mepolish&quot;.
	</li>
	<li><b>Mounting the Filesysten</b>: Select &quot;File&quot; -&gt; &quot;Mount Filesystem...&quot; -&gt;
	&quot;Local Directory&quot; and select the folder into which you have installed J2ME Polish.
	<br/>Note: Don't navigate into the directory. Just select the J2ME Polish directory and click &quot;Finish&quot;.
	 </li>
	<li><b>Executing J2ME Polish</b>: Open the mounted file-system (switch to the file-system-window
	by pressing &quot;Control-2&quot;), locate the file 
	&quot;build.xml&quot;, right-click it and select &quot;Execute&quot;.
	After the execution you will find the created applications in the &quot;dist&quot; folder.
	</li>
	<li><b>Mounting the Libraries</b>: Open the mounted file-system, open the &quot;import&quot; directory
	and right-click the &quot;enough-j2mepolish-client&quot; jar and select &quot;Mount JAR&quot;.
	Do the same with the libraries &quot;midp2&quot;, &quot;mmapi&quot;, &quot;nokia-ui&quot; and &quot;wmapi&quot;. 
	</li>
	<li><b>Open the Sample Application</b>: You can now change the sample application, if you
	want to. You can find it in the &quot;src&quot; directory (in the package &quot;de.enough.polish.example&quot;).
	</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="antsetup">Setup and Configuration of Ant</h2>
<p>
Ant only needs to be configured when it should be called from the command-line.
Since Ant is integrated in every modern Java-IDE, you just need to right-click
the &quot;build.xml&quot;-file in your IDE and choose &quot;Run Ant...&quot; (or similar).
</p>
<p>
After you have downloaded and installed Ant (<a href="http://ant.apache.org" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org</a>),
you need to set your PATH-environment variable, so that the &quot;ant&quot;-command
can be found. If you have installed Ant into &quot;C:\tools\ant&quot; then
enter following command on your Windows-command-line (or your shell-script):
<pre>
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\tools\ant\bin
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You can change the PATH variable permanently in the System-Settings of Windows 
(Control Center -> System -> Advanced -> Environment variables).
</p>
<p>
Now you need set the JAVA_HOME variable as well, e.g.:
<pre>
SET JAVA_HOME=C:\j2sdk1.4.2
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Under Unix/Linux/Mac OS X please use the &quot;export&quot; command instead of the &quot;SET&quot;
command.
</p>
<p>
Now you should be able to issue following calls from the command-line (make sure
that you are in the J2ME Polish installation folder):
<pre>
echo Just calling ant to build and obfuscate the example:
ant

echo Now calling ant with the test-property set to true, so the build is faster:
ant test j2mepolish
</pre>
</p>

<h2 id="existing">Integrating J2ME Polish with an Existing Project</h2>
<p>
You can use J2ME Polish for any existing project by copying the file &quot;build.xml&quot; 
as well as the folders &quot;import&quot; and &quot;resources&quot; to the root-folder of the
project. You then need to adjust the &quot;build.xml&quot; and the 
&quot;resources/polish.css&quot; files.
</p>
<p>Here are the required steps:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>make sure you use the latest release (current release is J2ME Polish <%= PolishVersion %>).
 </li>
 <li>copy your sources to the &quot;src&quot; folder of your J2ME Polish installation (or copy the &quot;build.xml&quot;, the &quot;import&quot; folder and the &quot;resources&quot; folder to your project-root). 
 </li>
 <li>Adjust the &quot;build.xml&quot; file: you need to specify your MIDlet class in 
 the &lt;midlet&gt; element. 
 You might also want to adjust the &lt;deviceRequirements&gt; element, 
 currently applications are build for 4 device-groups: 
 <br/>1) Nokia Series 60 (&quot;Nokia/Series60&quot;), 
 <br/>2) Nokia Series 60 with MIDP/2.0 (&quot;Nokia/Series60Midp2&quot;), 
 <br/>3) Any MIDP/1.0 phone(&quot;Generic/midp1&quot;), 
 <br/>4) Any MIDP/2.0 phone (&quot;Generic/midp2&quot;).
 </li>
 <li>If you want to use the J2ME Polish GUI, you need to make changes to the &quot;resources/polish.css&quot; file. 
 <br/><b>Tip</b>: use dynamic styles like &quot;form&quot; and &quot;list&quot; for a start. 
 </li>
 <li>
 If you do not want to use the J2ME Polish GUI, disable it by setting the &quot;usePolishGui&quot;-attribute of the &lt;build&gt;-element to &quot;false&quot;.
 </li>
 <li>Ensure that your <a href="#antsetup">Ant-setup</a> is correct, do you have set the JAVA_HOME environment variable?
 </li>
</ul>
