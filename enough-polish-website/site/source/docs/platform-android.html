<h1 id="top">Developing for Android Devices</h1>
<%index %>
<p>
<br />
The Android platform is a Java - driven platform for mobile devices from
Google. In J2ME Polish, you can develop normal MIDlet applications and
simply convert these applications to the native Android application
format.
</p>
<h2 id="android-preparation">Preparations</h2>
<p>To create and deploy application for Android all thats needed is
the android sdk with the version 1.0 or higher. Please visit the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/android/download.html">Android
Download Site</a> to download the SDK for your operation system and install
it.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can install the Android ADT Plugins for eclipse.
For further information how to install the plugins, go to the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html">Android
Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>After the installation of the Android SDK you should define the <code>android.home</code> property
in either <i>${polish.home}/global.properties</i>,
${project.home}/${user.name}.properties or in your <i>build.xml</i>
script. In your <i>build.xml</i> script the definition could look like
this:
<pre>
&lt;property 
	name=&quot;android.home&quot; 
	location=&quot;C:/Program Files/android-sdk-windows-1.5_r1&quot; 
/&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<h2 id="android-building">Building Android Application</h2>
<p>To convert, compile and package your source code for the Android
platform, you simply need to set <code>Generic/android</code> as the device to
build your application for. You can also target a more specific phone like the <code>Generic/android1.1</code> (for Android 1.1 phones),
 <code>Generic/android1.5</code> (for Android 1.5 phones), or <code>HTC/G1</code>.
</p>
<p>The building of the application is done in these steps (fully automatically):
</p>
<ol>
	<li>An activity is created in <code>/activity</code> of the
	Android build folder. </li>
	<li>The <i>R.java</i> / <i>Manifest.java</i> files are created from the resources and
	sources via <code>aapt</code> of the Android SDK</li>
	<li>The code is compiled with <code>target</code> and <code>source</code> set to <code>Java 1.5</code> (so yes, you can use Generics etc)</li>
	<li>A file named <i>classes.dex</i> is created from the source code using the <code>dx</code> utility 
	of the Android SDK</li>
	<li>The resources are packed to a <i>.ap_</i> file with <code>aapt</code></li>
	<li>The application is packaged to a <i>.apk</i> file with the SDK's <code>apkbuilder</code> command</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="android-testing">Testing Android application</h2>
<p>
There are two possibilities to test Android application build with J2ME Polish:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the <code>test</code> Ant property is set to true or if you call the <code>emulator</code> target, 
the Android emulator is started automatically 
and the application is installed. Before launching your application, please wait for the <i>build.xml</i>
to output <i>Successfully installed</i>. To rebuild the application and test it, just cancel 
the running <i>build.xml</i> and leave the emulator running, the build process will automatically detect 
if there's an emulator running and install the application to the running emulator. 
If you application is running at that time, it will be shut down automatically. You can also 
start the emulator before the build process is started.
</li>
<li>
The created activity in the <code>build</code> folder can also be imported to Eclipse and used to 
test via the Android ADT Plugins if they're installed. Please note that you need to fix the project to use it with the ADT
plugins. To do so, right-click the imported activity and run <i>Android
Tools / Fix Project Properties</i>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To show output send to <code>System.out</code> or <code>System.err</code> you can either use the Eclipse plugin 
or start the Android tool <code>ddms</code>, which you can find in <i>${android.home}/tools</i>.
</p>

<h2 id="android-configuring">Configuring Commands</h2>
<p>
You can use J2ME Polish for rendering commands or use native Android commands. This is being configured with the fullscreen mode of J2ME Polish
 - set it to <code>false</code> for using native Android commands and to <code>menu</code> for using J2ME Polish rendered commands. 
 Note that at the moment you need to use J2ME Polish rendering when using subcommands. Often you will want to use native Android commands:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.FullScreen&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; if=&quot;polish.android&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This setting needs to be applied to the <code>&lt;variables&gt;</code> section of the <code>&lt;j2mepolish&gt;</code> task in your
<i>build.xml</i> script.
<br />Here you can see the difference in the rendering behavior in the J2ME Polish <i>rssbrowser</i> sample application:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="<%= basedir%>images/gui-android-commands-j2mepolish.png" width="319" height="481" alt="Commands rendered by J2ME Polish." />
<br />
Commands rendered by J2ME Polish.

<td>
<img src="<%= basedir%>images/gui-android-commands-native.png" width="319" height="479" alt="Commands rendered by Android." /> 
<br />
Native Android commands.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="android-APIs">Supported APIs</h2>
<p>
A couple of common J2ME APIs are now supported by J2ME Polish:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>JSR 139 CLDC 1.1</b>: The basic Java technologies are provided by the Android stack itself</li>
	<li><b>JSR 118 MIDP 2.0</b>: The basic mobile information device profile APIs are supported, including RMS, low level LCDUI functionalities, HTTP connections, and <code>http:</code> and <code>tel:</code> platform requests</li>
	<li><b>JSR 075 FileConnection</b>: You can access file objects on Android</li>
	<li><b>JSR 075 PIM</b>: Read the native address book</li>
	<li><b>JSR 179 Location</b>: Access the GPS on Android devices</li>
</ul>
<p>
For playing back audio please use the <code>de.enough.polish.multimedia.AudiPlayer</code> for now. Direct usage of the MMAPI is not yet supported.
</p>


<h2 id="android-roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>
Future versions of the Android conversion will support the conversion of the following Java Packages: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>MMAPI (use  <code>de.enough.polish.multimedia.AudiPlayer</code> for now) </li>
	<li>Bluetooth API</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="android-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<b>The creation of the .dex file terminates with an OutOfMemoryError</b>
<p>
This error is quite common and due to insufficient memory settings in the dx executable of the android installation.
Please go to ${android.home}/tools and open the dx executable. Remove <code>REM</code> from the line
</p>
<pre>
REM set javaOpts=-Xmx256M
</pre>
<p>
and rerun the build process. If the error occurs again, increase the settings for -Xmx to a higher amount.
</p>
