<h1 id="top">Running and Debugging a J2ME Polish Project</h1>
<%index %>
<p>You can run and debug your MIDlets just by right-clicking your project and choose &quot;Debug As.../J2ME Polish MIDlet&quot; or &quot;Run As.../J2ME Polish MIDlet&quot;.
</p>
<h2 id="details">Detailed Debugging/Running Guide</h2>
<p>
Open a midlet with the J2ME Polish Editor.

<p>
Set breakpoints in the code. (v0.7.x: left-clicking the margin does not work. Use right-click and "Toogle Breakpoint" instead.)
</p>

<p>
Choose &quot;Debug As.../J2ME Polish MIDlet&quot;. In case you just want to launch the emulator, choose &quot;Run As.../J2ME Polish MIDlet&quot;.
</p>

<p>
The emulator is now starting up and the debugger is connected. If the running midlet hits the breakpoint the source in question is displayed.
