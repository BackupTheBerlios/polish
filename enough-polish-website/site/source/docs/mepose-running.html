<p>
Set breakpoints in the code. (v0.7.x: left-clicking the margin does not work. Use right-click and "Toogle Breakpoint" instead.)
</p>

<p>
Choose "Debug As.../J2ME Polish MIDlet".
</p>

<p>
The emulator is now starting up and the debugger is connected. If the running midlet hits the breakpoint the source in question is displayed.
