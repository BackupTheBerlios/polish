	<p>
	Serialization is the process of writing objects into streams and complementary reconstructing them from streams.
	This mechanism has many uses like persisting objects (saving and loading them) or transmitting them
	over connections like an HTTP connection.
	</p>
	<p>
	With the J2ME Polish serialization framework it's extremely easy to make objects serializable - just implementing the (empty) interface <a href="<%= javadocdir %>../javadoc/j2me/de/enough/polish/io/Serializable.html">de.enough.polish.io.Serializable</a> is enough.
