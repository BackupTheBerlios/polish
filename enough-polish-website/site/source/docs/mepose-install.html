	<li>Open Window Preferences to make 2 adjustments:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the &quot;Debug&quot; panel and uncheck the item &quot;Suspend execution on uncaugt exceptions&quot;.</li>
		<li>Locate the &quot;Installation&quot; panel within the J2ME Polish menu and enter at least the J2ME Polish installation directory and the WTK installation directory.</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
<p>Detailed information for these necessary steps are given below.</p>
