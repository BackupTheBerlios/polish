	<h1 id="top">Non-MIDP Platforms</h1>
<p>
J2ME Polish can be adjusted to support several platforms that support more than the normal MIDP profile.
The key for this support is the ${polish.home}/platforms.xml file, inclusion of platform specific
(boot) classpaths, and the automatic invocation of preprocessors, postcompilers, finalizers and so on.
</p>
<p>
Following Platforms are supported out of the box:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="platform-blackberry.html">BlackBerry</a></li>
	<li><a href="platform-palm.html">Palm</a></li>
	<li><a href="platform-doja.html">DoJa</a></li>
</ul>
