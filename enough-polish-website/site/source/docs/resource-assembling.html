	<h1 id="top">Assembling of Resources</h1>
	<p>
	During the build process resources like images, sound files etc. are assembled for each device.
	</p><p>
Resources for all devices will be placed into the &quot;resources&quot; folder (when no other directory has been specified with the &quot;resDir&quot;-attribute of the &lt;build&gt;-element in the &quot;build.xml&quot; file).
	</p><p>
Resources for devices of specific vendors  can be placed into the &quot;resources/[vendor-name]&quot; folder, e.g. the &quot;resources/Nokia&quot; folder for Nokia devices. Resources for a specific device can be placed into the &quot;resources/[vendor-name]/[device-name]&quot; folder, e.g. the folder &quot;resources/Nokia/3650&quot; for Nokia/3650 devices. 
	</p><p>
For more general resources the groups can be used to which a device belongs to. High-color images can be be put into the &quot;resources/BitsPerColor.16+&quot; folder, for example. The groups can be used very efficiently to include only those resources which are actually relevant for a specific device. A device can belong to many different groups, which are defined either implicitly by the capabilities of that device (compare the section &quot;Device Capabilities&quot; on page 12) or explicitly by setting the &lt;groups&gt;-element of a device in the device-database.
	</p><p>
All resources will be copied to the root of the application and more specific resources will overwrite the common resources: If you have a picture named &quot;hello.png&quot; in the &quot;resources&quot; folder as well as in the &quot;resources/Nokia&quot; and in the &quot;resources/Nokia/6600&quot; folder, the version in the &quot;resources&quot; folder will be used for all non-Nokia devices, the version contained in the &quot;resources/Nokia&quot; folder will be used for all Nokia devices, but the image &quot;resources/Nokia/6600/hello.png&quot; will be used for the application which is build for the Nokia/6600 phone. 
<br/>
In the application code you can load this image as any other resource from the root: 
<pre>
Image.createImage( &quot;/hello.png&quot; );
</pre>
	</p><p>
	The adjustments of designs for different devices is described in the 
	<a href="css-groups.html">CSS-documentation</a>.
	</p><p>
For a complete list of groups for a specific device, please refer to the 
<a href="../devices-overview.html">Device Database</a>.
