	<h2>What is J2ME Polish?</h2>
	<p>
		J2ME Polish is suite of tools for creating &quot;polished&quot; J2ME applications.
		Each tool meets a definite need
		of J2ME developers:  
		<br />
		Build-tools with an integrated device-database, 
		a powerful GUI, a framework for building localized applications,
		a game-engine, a logging framework and a collection of utilities.

		<h3 id="build">Build Tools</h3>
		<p>
		The <a href="docs/build.html">build-tool</a> takes care for the common tasks of
		preprocessing, compilation, obfuscation, preverification,
		packaging and JAD-creation. Thanks to the integrated device
		database, device-optimzation is easier than ever.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b><a href="docs/build-deviceRequirements.html">Device Selection</a></b>:
			Select the devices for which the application should be build.
			This can be done explicitly by listing the devices or
			implicitly by stating requirements for the devices (e.g.
			&quot;use all devices which support the MIDP/2.0 standard or
			the Mobile Media API&quot;).
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="docs/preprocessing.html">Preprocessing</a></b>:
			Create faster, leaner and device optimized applications
			with the power of J2ME Polish' preprocessing capabilities and the integrated
			<a href="devices-overview.html">device database</a>. 
			Check and use device specifications within 
			your code without using hardcoded values or risking 
			the portability of your application.
			<br/>
			You can use any device-capabilities which are defined
			in the device database:
<pre>
//#if polish.api.mmapi || polish.midp2
	import javax.microedition.javax.microedition.media.*;
//#endif
</pre>			
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="docs/build-build.html">Compilation &amp; Preverifying</a></b>:
			J2ME Polish compiles and preverifies everything automatically.
			No need to set APIs or the classpath or to define the float
			support of CLDC/1.1-devices manually. 
			<br />
			Many APIs like the Mobile Media
			API, the Wireless Messaging API, Nokia's User Interface API as well
			as the MIDP/1.0 and MIDP/2.0 APIs are already included into
			J2ME Polish for your convenience.
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="docs/build-build.html#obfuscator">Obfuscation</a></b>:
			J2ME Polish has build-in support for the 
			<a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">ProGuard</a> 
			as well as the 
			<a href="http://www.retrologic.com" target="_blank">RetroGuard</a>
			obfuscator, which both shrink and
			scramble your application code. Other obfuscators can be 
			<a href="docs/custom-obfuscator.html">integrated</a> easily.
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="docs/build-build.html#jad">JAR and JAD creation</a></b>: J2ME Polish packages
			the application and creates the appropriate JAD file automatically.
			Custom JAD-attributes can be set, of course.
			</li>
			<li><a href="docs/extending.html"><b>Extensible</b></a>:
			Integrate third party obfuscators and use you own
			preprocessing directives.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="devicedatabase">Device Database</h3>
		<p>J2ME Polish includes a <a href="devices-overview.html">device database</a>
		with over 150 J2ME devices. This database delivers the data for the
		powerful preprocessing capabilities of J2ME Polish. The database
		can be easily extended and is updated regularily.
		</p>
		<h3 id="gui">The J2ME Polish GUI</h3>
		<p>
		J2ME Polish also offers a <a href="docs/css.html">powerful GUI</a> 
		which works on MIDP/1.0 as well as on MIDP/2.0 devices and which can be designed
		using simple CSS-textfiles, a technique which every webdesigner
		masters.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="docs/css.html"><b>CSS Design</b></a>: Use the webstandard CSS 
			for designing your
				J2ME application. Simple text files control the
				outer appearance of your application. Designers
				can work independently of the programmers at last! The 
				design and all the content can be easiliy adjusted
				for specific devices or device groups.
			</li>
			<li><b>Standards Compliant</b>:
			The J2ME Polish GUI is fully compliant to the MIDP/2.0 standard.
			This means that you can use MIDP/2.0 features like a POPUP
			ChoiceGroup on MIDP/1.0 devices as well.<br/>
			Also the programmer does not need to learn a new API, and needs
			to use only the standard MIDP for coding - 
			J2ME Polish &quot;weaves&quot; the
			necessary APIs during the build-process into the application.
			</li>
			<li><a href="docs/optimization.html"><b>Device Optimization</b></a>: 
				Most optimizations are needed for the user
				interface. Create standard MIDP applications
				and let J2ME&nbsp;Polish do the optimization work for you -
				automatically. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="docs/build-build.html#attributes"><b>Optional &amp; Controllable</b></a>:
			The GUI can be turned off completely if desired and can be
			controlled by simple switches in the &quot;build.xml&quot;.
			By default the GUI is not used for very old devices which
			have not the necessary capabilities for supporting the
			J2ME Polish GUI.
			</li>
			<li><a href="docs/css.html"><b>Powerful</b></a>:
			Use animated backgrounds, fullscreen canvases, designable
			menu-bars and titles and more.
			</li>
			<li><a href="docs/extending.html"><b>Extensible</b></a>:
			You can extend the GUI with standard 
			<a href="docs/custom-item.html">CustomItem</a> and
			add your own <a href="docs/custom-background.html">backgrounds</a> 
			and <a href="docs/custom-border.html">borders</a>.			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="localization">Localization Framework</h3>
		<p>
		With J2ME Polish's <a href="docs/localization.html">localization framework</a> you 
		can easily create localized applications. In contrast to any other
		localization framework, applications which are localized with
		J2ME Polish have absolutely no overhead in size or performance 
		compared with non-localized applications. You can localize messages,
		resources and use advanced features like date-formatting. 
		</p>
		<h3 id="gameengine">Game Engine</h3>
		<p>
		With J2ME Polish's <a href="docs/game-engine.html">game-engine</a> you 
		can use the MIDP/2.0 game-API for MIDP/1.0 devices as well. With one
		source code you can now deliver for all J2ME devices!
		</p>
		<h3 id="logging">Logging Framework</h3>
		<p>
		With the <a href="docs/introduction.html#logging">logging framework</a> 
		simple System.out.println()-messages can be shown on real devices.
		The framework allows a fine grained control like the popular log4j-framework
		and can be disabled completely.
		</p>
		<h3 id="utilities">Utilities</h3>
		<p>
		Use some often needed <a href="docs/utilities.html">utilities</a> which are not 
		available in the J2ME standard, e.g. the ArrayList or the text utility.
		</p>
