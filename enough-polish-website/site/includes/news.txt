<p>
	After nine months of intense programming, the 
	<a href="<%= newsbasedir %>downloads/j2mepolish-1.0.1.html">1.0 release<a/> of J2ME Polish
	has now been released.
	<br/>
	It contains several improvements compared to the last release candidate:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>GUI</b>: some memory optimizations result in smaller
	JAR files as well as less heap usage.
	<br/>DateField did not return correctly after editing. This behaviour has been fixed.
	<br/>Some new borders and backgrounds have been added:
	<ul>
		<li>circle-border: a border which draws a simple circle.</li>
		<li>circle-background: a background which draws a simple circle.</li>
		<li>pulsating-circle-background: an animated background which draws a circle, which
		is constantly growing and shrinking.</li>
		<li>pulsating-circles-background: an animated background which draws 
		ever-growing circles.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>JAD- and Manifest-Attributes</b>: 
	Custom attributes will now be copied only into the JAD file,
	unless a manifest attributes-filter is used.
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Database</b>: 
	Updated and added device definitions. Also added the new &quot;Generic/jsr185&quot;
	device, which represents a standard MIDP/2.0 device with WMAPI and MMAPI support.
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: The new #message directive can
	be used to analyse the behaviour of the preprocessing phase:
	<pre>
	//#message Using update-url &quot;${update-url}&quot;.
	</pre>
	</li>
</ul>


<p class="newsdate">2004-07-20:</p>
<h2 id="1.0rc7release">J2ME Polish 1.0 RC7</h2>
<p>The RC6 release created invalid JAR-files under Windows.
Please update to <a href="<%= newsbasedir %>downloads/j2mepolish-1.0-RC7.html">RC7 release</a>
now, when you develop under Windows.
</p>

<p class="newsdate">2004-07-17:</p>
<h2 id="1.0rc6release">J2ME Polish 1.0 RC6</h2>
<p>The 
<a href="<%= newsbasedir %>downloads/j2mepolish-1.0-RC7.html">latest release candidate of Version 1.0</a> 
offers a bag full of improvements and bugfixes. If you use an earlier version,
<a href="<%= newsbasedir %>downloads/j2mepolish-1.0-RC7.html">upgrade now</a>:
<ul>
	<li><b>Game-API</b>: Thanks to Jan Peknik the game engine is now much more optimized. 
	Many bugfixes have been made and now MIDP/2.0 games can now be ported to MIDP/1.0 
	platforms automatically by J2ME Polish.
	</li>
	<li><b>JAD- and Manifest-Attributes</b>: JAD- and MANIFEST-attributes are now always in the same order,
	also the MicroEdition-Configuration attribute is now set correctly for CLDC/1.1 devices.
	JAD-attributes can now be sorted and filtered with the new &lt;filter&gt;-sub-element
	of the &lt;jad&gt;-element. Manifest-attributes can be filtered and sorted
	with the new &lt;manifestFilter&gt;-element.
	Info-Section: The &lt;info&gt;-element now accepts the additional
	attributes &quot;permissions&quot; and &quot;optionalPermissions&quot;.
	</li>
	<li><b>Preverifying</b>: J2ME Polish now supports Wireless Toolkits earlier than
	the current 2.1 release (again).
	</li>
	<li><b>Obfuscating</b>: 
	Several obfuscators can now be combined and used together. 
	Just define several &lt;obfuscator&gt;-elements
	in the &lt;build&gt;-section. 
	No mixed-case class-names are now used
	under Unix anymore, since some devices have problems with such
	JAR files.
	The integration of RetroGuard had an error (it did obfuscate
	all classes, even the MIDLet classes), which is now fixed.
	Other obfuscators can now be integrated easier than ever.
	</li>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: Any group to which a device belongs to can now be
	checked with the &quot;polish.group.[group-name]&quot;
	</pre>
	One can extend the J2ME Polish preprocessing capabilities using
	&lt;preprocessor&gt;-element now.
	The #define directive can now be used for defining variables as well.
	</li>
	<li><b>GUI</b>: the GUI can now be extended with the CustomItem,
	the integration of custom backgrounds and borders has been eased.
	</li>
	<li><b>Documentation</b>: The documentation received a major upgrade
	with the introduction to J2ME Polish and the &quot;Extending J2ME Polish&quot;
	documentation.
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="newsdate">2004-07-06:</p>
<h2 id="1.0rc5release">J2ME Polish 1.0 RC5</h2>
<p>J2ME Polish has matured (again ;-) with the 
<a href="<%= newsbasedir %>downloads/j2mepolish-1.0-RC5.html">fifth release candidate</a> of version 1.0:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>MIDlets</b>: It is now checked whether the classes defined by the 
	&lt;midlet&gt;-attribute do really exist.
	</li>
	<li><b>Integration</b>: On some setups J2ME Polish could not resolve relative paths
	correctly. Now these paths are always resolved correctly. J2ME Polish integrates
	now better with NetBeans and some other IDEs therefore.
	<li><b>Device-Database</b>: Added Toshiba and TTPCom devices, the preprocessing
	        symbols &quot;polish.cldc1.0&quot; and &quot;polish.cldc1.1&quot; can now be used.
	</li>
	<li><b>Preverification</b>: floating point calculations are now allowed
	for CLDC/1.1 devices, but not for CLDC/1.0 devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1.0rc4release">J2ME Polish 1.0 RC4</h2>
<p>J2ME Polish has matured with the <a href="<%= newsbasedir %>downloads/j2mepolish-1.0-RC4.html">fourth release candidate</a> of version 1.0:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Bugfixes</b>: 
		<br/>Calling setTitle(..) now works as well when a Screen has not been shown yet.
		<br/>When GUI items are changed while the corresponding screen is shown, the
		screen is updated immediately.
		<br/>
		</li>
	<li><b>Device-Database</b>: Added two more virtual devices:
		<br/>&quot;Generic/PlainMidp1&quot; represents a MIDP/1.0 device which does not support the J2ME Polish GUI,
		<br/>&quot;Generic/PlainMidp2&quot; represents a MIDP/2.0 device which does not support the J2ME Polish GUI.
		<br/>Also some other devices have been added: Alcatel, LG Electronics, Samsung, and more.
	</li>
	<li><b>Label</b>: Labels are now handled independently and can have their own background, border and so on.
		The new pre-defined style &quot;label&quot;  is now used for the 
		default-design of labels.</li>
	<li><b>New Resource Groups</b>: A device now belongs to implicit groups for each
	  supported audio of video format. When the device supports the MIDI format,
	  you can use the folder &quot;resources/midi&quot; for example.</li>
