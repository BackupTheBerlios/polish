/**
 * A <code>TextField</code> is an editable text component that may be
 * placed into
 * a <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Form.html"><CODE>Form</CODE></A>. It can be
 * given a piece of text that is used as the initial value.
 * 
 * <P>A <code>TextField</code> has a maximum size, which is the
 * maximum number of characters
 * that can be stored in the object at any time (its capacity). This limit is
 * enforced when the <code>TextField</code> instance is constructed,
 * when the user is editing text within the <code>TextField</code>, as well as
 * when the application program calls methods on the
 * <code>TextField</code> that modify its
 * contents. The maximum size is the maximum stored capacity and is unrelated
 * to the number of characters that may be displayed at any given time.
 * The number of characters displayed and their arrangement into rows and
 * columns are determined by the device. </p>
 * 
 * <p>The implementation may place a boundary on the maximum size, and the
 * maximum size actually assigned may be smaller than the application had
 * requested.  The value actually assigned will be reflected in the value
 * returned by <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextField.html#getMaxSize()"><CODE>getMaxSize()</CODE></A>.  A defensively-written
 * application should compare this value to the maximum size requested and be
 * prepared to handle cases where they differ.</p>
 * 
 * <a name="constraints"></a>
 * <h3>Input Constraints</h3>
 * 
 * <P>The <code>TextField</code> shares the concept of <em>input
 * constraints</em> with the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextBox.html"><CODE>TextBox</CODE></A> class. The different
 * constraints allow the application to request that the user's input be
 * restricted in a variety of ways. The implementation is required to
 * restrict the user's input as requested by the application. For example, if
 * the application requests the <code>NUMERIC</code> constraint on a
 * <code>TextField</code>, the
 * implementation must allow only numeric characters to be entered. </p>
 * 
 * <p>The <em>actual contents</em> of the text object are set and modified by
 * and are
 * reported to the application through the <code>TextBox</code> and
 * <code>TextField</code> APIs.  The <em>displayed contents</em> may differ
 * from the actual contents if the implementation has chosen to provide
 * special formatting suitable for the text object's constraint setting.
 * For example, a <code>PHONENUMBER</code> field might be displayed with
 * digit separators and punctuation as
 * appropriate for the phone number conventions in use, grouping the digits
 * into country code, area code, prefix, etc. Any spaces or punctuation
 * provided are not considered part of the text object's actual contents. For
 * example, a text object with the <code>PHONENUMBER</code>
 * constraint might display as
 * follows:</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * (408) 555-1212    
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>but the actual contents of the object visible to the application
 * through the APIs would be the string
 * &quot;<code>4085551212</code>&quot;.
 * The <code>size</code> method reflects the number of characters in the
 * actual contents, not the number of characters that are displayed, so for
 * this example the <code>size</code> method would return <code>10</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Some constraints, such as <code>DECIMAL</code>, require the
 * implementation to perform syntactic validation of the contents of the text
 * object.  The syntax checking is performed on the actual contents of the
 * text object, which may differ from the displayed contents as described
 * above.  Syntax checking is performed on the initial contents passed to the
 * constructors, and it is also enforced for all method calls that affect the
 * contents of the text object.  The methods and constructors throw
 * <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> if they would result in the contents
 * of the text object not conforming to the required syntax.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The value passed to the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextField.html#setConstraints(int)"><CODE>setConstraints()</CODE></A> method
 * consists of a restrictive constraint setting described above, as well as a
 * variety of flag bits that modify the behavior of text entry and display.
 * The value of the restrictive constraint setting is in the low order
 * <code>16</code> bits
 * of the value, and it may be extracted by combining the constraint value
 * with the <code>CONSTRAINT_MASK</code> constant using the bit-wise
 * <code>AND</code> (<code>&amp;</code>) operator.
 * The restrictive constraint settings are as follows:
 * 
 * <blockquote><code>
 * ANY<br>
 * EMAILADDR<br>
 * NUMERIC<br>
 * PHONENUMBER<br>
 * URL<br>
 * DECIMAL<br>
 * </code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>The modifier flags reside in the high order <code>16</code> bits
 * of the constraint
 * value, that is, those in the complement of the
 * <code>CONSTRAINT_MASK</code> constant.
 * The modifier flags may be tested individually by combining the constraint
 * value with a modifier flag using the bit-wise <code>AND</code>
 * (<code>&amp;</code>) operator.  The
 * modifier flags are as follows:
 * 
 * <blockquote><code>
 * PASSWORD<br>
 * UNEDITABLE<br>
 * SENSITIVE<br>
 * NON_PREDICTIVE<br>
 * INITIAL_CAPS_WORD<br>
 * INITIAL_CAPS_SENTENCE<br>
 * </code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <a name="modes"></a>
 * <h3>Input Modes</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The <code>TextField</code> shares the concept of <em>input
 * modes</em> with the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextBox.html"><CODE>TextBox</CODE></A> class.  The application can request that the
 * implementation use a particular input mode when the user initiates editing
 * of a <code>TextField</code> or <code>TextBox</code>.  The input
 * mode is a concept that exists within
 * the user interface for text entry on a particular device.  The application
 * does not request an input mode directly, since the user interface for text
 * entry is not standardized across devices.  Instead, the application can
 * request that the entry of certain characters be made convenient.  It can do
 * this by passing the name of a Unicode character subset to the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextField.html#setInitialInputMode(java.lang.String)"><CODE>setInitialInputMode()</CODE></A> method.  Calling this method
 * requests that the implementation set the mode of the text entry user
 * interface so that it is convenient for the user to enter characters in this
 * subset.  The application can also request that the input mode have certain
 * behavioral characteristics by setting modifier flags in the constraints
 * value.
 * 
 * <p>The requested input mode should be used whenever the user initiates the
 * editing of a <code>TextBox</code> or <code>TextField</code> object.
 * If the user had changed input
 * modes in a previous editing session, the application's requested input mode
 * should take precedence over the previous input mode set by the user.
 * However, the input mode is not restrictive, and the user is allowed to
 * change the input mode at any time during editing.  If editing is already in
 * progress, calls to the <code>setInitialInputMode</code> method do not
 * affect the current input mode, but instead take effect at the next time the
 * user initiates editing of this text object.
 * 
 * <p>The initial input mode is a hint to the implementation.  If the
 * implementation cannot provide an input mode that satisfies the
 * application's request, it should use a default input mode.
 * 
 * <P>The input mode that results from the application's request is not a
 * restriction on the set of characters the user is allowed to enter.  The
 * user MUST be allowed to switch input modes to enter any character that is
 * allowed within the current constraint setting.  The constraint
 * setting takes precedence over an input mode request, and the implementation
 * may refuse to supply a particular input mode if it is inconsistent with the
 * current constraint setting.
 * 
 * <P>For example, if the current constraint is <code>ANY</code>, the call</P>
 * 
 * <TABLE BORDER="2">
 * <TR>
 * <TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
 * <pre><code>
 * setInitialInputMode("MIDP_UPPERCASE_LATIN");    </code></pre>
 * </TD>
 * </TR>
 * </TABLE>
 * 
 * <p>should set the initial input mode to allow entry of uppercase Latin
 * characters.  This does not restrict input to these characters, and the user
 * will be able to enter other characters by switching the input mode to allow
 * entry of numerals or lowercase Latin letters.  However, if the current
 * constraint is <code>NUMERIC</code>, the implementation may ignore
 * the request to set an
 * initial input mode allowing <code>MIDP_UPPERCASE_LATIN</code>
 * characters because these
 * characters are not allowed in a <code>TextField</code> whose
 * constraint is <code>NUMERIC</code>.  In
 * this case, the implementation may instead use an input mode that allows
 * entry of numerals, since such an input mode is most appropriate for entry
 * of data under the <code>NUMERIC</code> constraint.
 * 
 * <P>A string is used to name the Unicode character subset passed as a
 * parameter to the
 * <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextField.html#setInitialInputMode(java.lang.String)"><CODE>setInitialInputMode()</CODE></A> method.
 * String comparison is case sensitive.
 * 
 * <P>Unicode character blocks can be named by adding the prefix
 * &quot;<code>UCB</code>_&quot; to the
 * the string names of fields representing Unicode character blocks as defined
 * in the J2SE class <code>java.lang.Character.UnicodeBlock</code>.  Any
 * Unicode character block may be named in this fashion.  For convenience, the
 * most common Unicode character blocks are listed below.
 * 
 * <blockquote><code>
 * UCB_BASIC_LATIN<br>
 * UCB_GREEK<br>
 * UCB_CYRILLIC<br>
 * UCB_ARMENIAN<br>
 * UCB_HEBREW<br>
 * UCB_ARABIC<br>
 * UCB_DEVANAGARI<br>
 * UCB_BENGALI<br>
 * UCB_THAI<br>
 * UCB_HIRAGANA<br>
 * UCB_KATAKANA<br>
 * UCB_HANGUL_SYLLABLES<br>
 * </code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <P>&quot;Input subsets&quot; as defined by the J2SE class
 * <code>java.awt.im.InputSubset</code> may be named by adding the prefix
 * &quot;<code>IS_</code>&quot; to the string names of fields
 * representing input subsets as defined
 * in that class.  Any defined input subset may be used.  For convenience, the
 * names of the currently defined input subsets are listed below.
 * 
 * <blockquote><code>
 * IS_FULLWIDTH_DIGITS<br>
 * IS_FULLWIDTH_LATIN<br>
 * IS_HALFWIDTH_KATAKANA<br>
 * IS_HANJA<br>
 * IS_KANJI<br>
 * IS_LATIN<br>
 * IS_LATIN_DIGITS<br>
 * IS_SIMPLIFIED_HANZI<br>
 * IS_TRADITIONAL_HANZI<br>
 * </code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <P>MIDP has also defined the following character subsets:
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 * <code>MIDP_UPPERCASE_LATIN</code> - the subset of
 * <code>IS_LATIN</code> that corresponds to
 * uppercase Latin letters
 * </blockquote>
 * <blockquote>
 * <code>MIDP_LOWERCASE_LATIN</code> - the subset of
 * <code>IS_LATIN</code> that corresponds to
 * lowercase Latin letters
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, implementation-specific character subsets may be named with
 * strings that have a prefix of &quot;<code>X_</code>&quot;.  In
 * order to avoid namespace conflicts,
 * it is recommended that implementation-specific names include the name of
 * the defining company or organization after the initial
 * &quot;<code>X_</code>&quot; prefix.
 * 
 * <p> For example, a Japanese language application might have a particular
 * <code>TextField</code> that the application intends to be used
 * primarily for input of
 * words that are &quot;loaned&quot; from languages other than Japanese.  The
 * application might request an input mode facilitating Hiragana input by
 * issuing the following method call:</p>
 * 
 * <TABLE BORDER="2">
 * <TR>
 * <TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
 * <pre><code>
 * textfield.setInitialInputMode("UCB_HIRAGANA");       </code></pre>
 * </TD>
 * </TR>
 * </TABLE>
 * <h3>Implementation Note</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations need not compile in all the strings listed above.
 * Instead, they need only to compile in the strings that name Unicode
 * character subsets that they support.  If the subset name passed by the
 * application does not match a known subset name, the request should simply
 * be ignored without error, and a default input mode should be used.  This
 * lets implementations support this feature reasonably inexpensively.
 * However, it has the consequence that the application cannot tell whether
 * its request has been accepted, nor whether the Unicode character subset it
 * has requested is actually a valid subset.
