Please copy all jar-files into the "import"-folder of your J2ME installation directory.

The provided "build.xml" needs to be adjusted:
- the "wtk.home" property needs to point to the installation directory of
  the Wireless Toolkit.
- the "polish.home" property needs to point to the installation directory of
  J2ME Polish.
- the "license" attribute of the <build>-elements needs to be either "GPL" or
  the commercial license key.

If you have installed the external device database-files, you
might want to copy the relevant files (devices.xml, vendors.xml, 
groups.xml and apis.xml) to the installation directory of J2ME Polish as well.

Please copy the provided custom-css-attributes.xml to the J2ME Polish installation 
directory. This file defines CSS attributes of your own CustomItems.
