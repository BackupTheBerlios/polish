Architecture
------------

Html/Css Engine: Responsible for transforming the DOM like inserting row boxes in tables if only table cell items are present.
  Also setting the CSS attributes in accordiance with the rules of inheritance and default values. It also associates
  CSS to nodes by interpreting the selectors. 

Renderer: A renderer gets a perfect DOM with associated style properties and will render it into the viewport.



===================================================================================================
Implementation Details

ScriptableObject subclasses
  - Readonly properties must be defined with two methods in exectly this order: setGetterOrSetter and defineProperty.
    The rational is that the method setGetterOrSetter will check if the property is readonly so the getter can not be set.



Styles
------

Every DomNode may have an associated Syle object. This style object is not the J2ME Polish Style object.
