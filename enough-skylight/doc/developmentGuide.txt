Architecture
------------

Html/Css Engine: Responsible for transforming the DOM like inserting row boxes in tables if only table cell items are present.
  Also setting the CSS attributes in accordiance with the rules of inheritance and default values. It also associates
  CSS to nodes by interpreting the selectors. 

Renderer: A renderer gets a perfect DOM with associated style properties and will render it into the viewport.





Styles
------

Every DomNode may have an associated Syle object. This style object is not the J2ME Polish Style object.
