	<h2 id="whycommercial">Why do I need a commercial license?</h2>
	<p>When you develop applications with J2ME Polish, specific APIs are woven into
	your application during the build process, i.e. the GUI classes, the serialization classes, the game-engine classes, 
	the localization classes, the logging classes, etc. Since your application then uses these classes
	you effectively link agains the J2ME Polish library. The GNU GPL license requires you to
	publish your completely source code solely under the GNU GPL again. That's why the alternative
	commercial licenses exist. These commercial licenses allow you to use J2ME Polish
	completely without any restrictions for your commercial applications.
	</p>
	<h2 id="gplsufficient">In what cases do I NOT need a commercial license?</h2>
	<p>You can use J2ME Polish commercially for closed source application as well, but you must not
	use any of the following advanced features in that case:
	</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>The J2ME Polish GUI</li>
	 <li>The Serialization Framework</li>
	 <li>The Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Framework</li>
	 <li>The Persistence Framework</li>
	 <li>The Game Engine / MIDP/2.0 compatible game-API</li>
	 <li>The Logging Framework</li>
	 <li>The Localization Framework</li>
	 <li>The BitMapFont classes</li>
	 <li>Any utility classes</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you use any of the above features you need to use the commercial license of J2ME Polish.
	</p>
	<p>You can use the building framework along with the device database, the preprocessing, the 
	resource assembling and so on for building commercial J2ME applications 
	without acquiring a commercial license.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can also extend J2ME Polish by using the extension points (that are all based on
	the de.enough.polish.Extension class) without needing to release your extension under the GPL.
	The same applies for your own backgrounds and borders that are based on J2ME Polish.
	So you can create and sell commercial extensions for J2ME Polish without needing to license J2ME Polish yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
	The device database itself is also licensed under the GPL, so if you want to use the database for
	something different than building your applications, you need our written consent first (or publish your
	project under the GPL again).
	</p>
	<h2 id="security">Security of Investments</h2>
	<p>When the development on J2ME Polish should be discontinued, Enough Software will license
	   the full product under the GNU Lesser General Public License, allowing
	   full commercial usage without limitations. Thus Enough Software
	   offers a very high investment security!

	Please use this <a href="order/Order-Form20.pdf">PDF form</a> for placing your 
	order via fax. You will receive your license key along with an invoice
	as soon as possible.
