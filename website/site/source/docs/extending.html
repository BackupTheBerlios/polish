	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>GUI:</b>

<h2  id="contribute">Contributing Your Extensions</h2>
<p>
Please consider to contribute your extensions to the J2ME&nbsp;Polish project. In an open source world, everyone can participate from the work of others.
</p><p>
Do note, however, that J2ME&nbsp;Polish is used commercially as well. Please get in touch with j2mepolish@enough.de to discuss your contribution.
</p><p>
We need the code and a complete documentation of your extension. Preferably the extension is documented in English, but German is also accepted. It is recommended to use the JavaDoc-conventions within the code for the basic documentation. The J2ME&nbsp;Polish project adheres to the normal Java style conventions. For distinguishing local from instance variables, please use the &quot;this&quot; operator for accessing instance variables. This behavior can be enforced in Eclipse by setting the compiler-option &quot;unqualified access to instance variables&quot;.
