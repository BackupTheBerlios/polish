<h1 id="top">Developing for Android Devices</h1>
<%index %>
<p>
<br />
The Android platform is an operating system and application environment for mobile devices developed by Google.
J2ME Polish will convert your MIDlet applications to this platform without further work on your site.
</p>
<h2 id="android-preparation">Preparations</h2>
<p>To create and deploy an application for Android you need the Android SDK with a version of 1.0 or higher. Please visit the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/android/download.html">Android
Download Site</a> to download the SDK for your operation system and install
it.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can install the Android ADT Plugins for eclipse.
For further information how to install the plugins, go to the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html">Android
Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>After the installation of the Android SDK you should define the <code>android.home</code> property
in either <i>${polish.home}/global.properties</i>,
${project.home}/${user.name}.properties or in your <i>build.xml</i>
script. In your <i>build.xml</i> script the definition could look like
this:
<pre>
&lt;property 
	name=&quot;android.home&quot; 
	location=&quot;C:/Program Files/android-sdk-windows-1.5_r1&quot; 
/&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<h2 id="android-building">Building Android Application</h2>
<p>To compile, convert and package your source code for the Android
platform, you build your application for the device <code>Generic/android</code>. To depend on a specific SDK version use <code>Generic/android1.1</code> for Android 1.1 phones and
<code>Generic/android1.5</code> for Android 1.5 phones. You can also target a specific phone like <code>HTC/G1</code>.
</p>
<p>The building of the application is done in these steps (fully automatically):
</p>
<ol>
	<li>An activity is created in <code>/activity</code> of the
	Android build folder. </li>
	<li>The <i>R.java</i> / <i>Manifest.java</i> files are created from the resources and
	sources via <code>aapt</code> of the Android SDK</li>
	<li>The code is compiled with <code>target</code> and <code>source</code> set to <code>Java 1.5</code></li>
	<li>A file named <i>classes.dex</i> is created from the source code using the <code>dx</code> utility 
	of the Android SDK</li>
	<li>The resources are packed to a <i>.ap_</i> file with <code>aapt</code></li>
	<li>The application is packaged to a <i>.apk</i> file with the SDK's <code>apkbuilder</code> command</li>
</ol>
The Android platform is based on Java 1.5 and your application can use the full range of features of this Java version.
<h2 id="android-testing">Testing Android application</h2>
<p>
There are two possibilities to test Android applications which are build with J2ME Polish:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the Ant property <code>test</code> is set to true or if you call the <code>emulator</code> target, 
the Android emulator is started automatically 
and the application is installed. Before launching your application, please wait for the <i>build.xml</i>
to output <i>Successfully installed</i>. To rebuild the application and test it, just cancel 
the running <i>build.xml</i> and leave the emulator running, the build process will automatically detect 
if there's an emulator running and install the application to the running emulator. 
If you application is running at deployment time, it will be shut down beforehand. You can also 
start the emulator before the build process is started.
</li>
<li>
The created activity in the <code>build</code> folder can be imported to Eclipse and used to 
test via the Android ADT Plugins if they're installed. Please note that you need to fix the project to use it with the ADT
plugins. To do so, right-click the imported activity and run <i>Android
Tools / Fix Project Properties</i>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To view output send to <code>System.out</code> or <code>System.err</code> you can either use the Eclipse plugin 
or start the Android tool <code>ddms</code>, which you can find in <i>${android.home}/tools</i>.
</p>

<h2 id="android-signing">Sign your Application</h2>
<p>Every Android application needs to be signed. The build process will automatically sign your application with a development signature which is accepted by a device or an emulator. To sign
your application with your own signature you can use the signing mechanism provided by J2ME Polish. Please see the <a href="build-build.html#sign"><code>sign</code> tag</a> for details.</p>
<p>Tip: Changing the signature of an application will not change its identity. If you try to install an already installed application with the same id but a different signature,
the system will assume fraud and will not allow the operation. So in order to change the development signature to a real one you need to deinstall the old application first. This also implies
that you should not deploy an application with a development signature to your customers. The customer would be forced to deinstall the application by hand in case you want to update the application.</p>

<h2 id="android-market">Publishing your Application on Android Market</h2>
<p>The Android Market is the One-Stop-Shop for applications on any Android handset. A published application can be downloaded by every Android user and you need not provide hosting and delivery methods.</p>
<p>To publish your application you need an Android Market account. Please see <a href="http://www.android.com/market">the offical Android Market site</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="android-configuring">Configuring Commands</h2>
<p>
The rendering of commands can be done by J2ME Polish or by the Android system. A command rendered by J2ME Polish will be stylable by you where a system rendered command will look nativly.</p>
<p>This is being configured with the fullscreen mode of J2ME Polish
 - set it to <code>false</code> for using native Android commands and to <code>menu</code> for using J2ME Polish rendered commands. 
 Note that at the moment you need to use J2ME Polish rendering when using subcommands.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.FullScreen&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; if=&quot;polish.android&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This setting needs to be applied to the <code>&lt;variables&gt;</code> section of the <code>&lt;j2mepolish&gt;</code> task in your
<i>build.xml</i> script.
<br />Here you can see the difference in the rendering behavior in the J2ME Polish <i>rssbrowser</i> sample application:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="<%= basedir%>images/gui-android-commands-j2mepolish.png" width="319" height="481" alt="Commands rendered by J2ME Polish." />
<br />
Commands rendered by J2ME Polish.
</td>
<td>
<img src="<%= basedir%>images/gui-android-commands-native.png" width="319" height="479" alt="Commands rendered by Android." /> 
<br />
Native Android commands.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<br />When using native commands, you cannot design colors or the general design of the commands, but like in normal J2ME Polish commands
you can specify command images with <code>icon-image</code> CSS attribute:
</p>
<p>In your Java code use a <code>#style</code> preprocessing directive to bind a style to a specific command:</p>
<pre>
//#style commandNext
Command cmdNext = new Command( "Next", Command.SCREEN, 2 );
</pre>
<p>Then define this style in your <i>polish.css</i> file accordingly:</p>
<pre>
.commandNext {
	icon-image: url( cmd_next.png ); 
}
</pre>

<h2 id="android-APIs">Supported APIs</h2>
<p>
A couple of common J2ME APIs are now supported by J2ME Polish:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>JSR 139 CLDC 1.1</b>: The basic Java technologies are provided by the Android stack itself</li>
	<li><b>JSR 118 MIDP 2.0</b>: The basic mobile information device profile APIs are supported, including RMS, low level LCDUI functionalities, HTTP connections, and <code>http:</code> and <code>tel:</code> platform requests</li>
	<li><b>JSR 075 FileConnection</b>: You can access file objects on Android</li>
	<li><b>JSR 075 PIM</b>: Read the native address book</li>
	<li><b>JSR 179 Location</b>: Access the GPS on Android devices</li>
</ul>
<p>
For playing back audio please use the <code>de.enough.polish.multimedia.AudiPlayer</code> for now. Direct usage of the MMAPI is not yet supported.
</p>


<h2 id="android-roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>
Future versions of the Android conversion will support the conversion of the following Java Packages: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>MMAPI (use  <code>de.enough.polish.multimedia.AudiPlayer</code> for now) </li>
	<li>Bluetooth API</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="android-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<b>The creation of the .dex file terminates with an OutOfMemoryError</b>
<p>
This error is quite common and due to insufficient memory settings in the dx executable of the android installation.
Please go to ${android.home}/tools and open the dx executable. Remove <code>REM</code> from the line
</p>
<pre>
REM set javaOpts=-Xmx256M
</pre>
<p>
and rerun the build process. If the error occurs again, increase the settings for -Xmx to a higher amount.
</p>
