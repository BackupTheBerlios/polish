	<p>
	Please note that Mepose is currently under heavy development and should not used within production environments right now. If you have any questions or comments, please <a href="../contact.html">email us</a> or submit your questions to the <a href="../discussion.html">discussion board</a>.
	<br />
	There are some known issues/limitations:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Debugging: Debugging is currently only really tested with the WTK. Nokia emulators also seem to work.
		</li>
		<li>Break-Points: Double clicking in the left frame of the source editor does not work. Please rightclick the left frame to toggle breakpoints.</li>
		<li>Closing Projects: after opening a closed J2ME Polish project you need to restart Eclipse.</li>
		<li>Currently you need to convert a J2ME Polish project again for changing the target devices.</li>
		<li>OS X: Debugging does not work with the Mobile Power Player (yet).</li>
