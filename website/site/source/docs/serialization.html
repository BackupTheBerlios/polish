	<p>
	Serialization supports the encoding of objects, and the objects reachable from them,
	into a stream of bytes; and it supports the complementary reconstruction of the object
	graph from the stream. Serialization can be used for lightweight persistence and for
	communication via sockets or Remote Method Invocation (RMI). The default encoding
	of objects protects private and transient data.
	</p>
	<p>
	To make an object serializable it needs to either implement the interface
	de.enough.polish.io.Serializable or the interface de.enough.polish.io.Externalizable.
	Objects of these types can then be used with the de.enough.polish.io.Serializer class
	and any input/output stream.
	</p>

	<p>
	When you just want serialize some data easily into a give stream and later read it back
	you should make the cass that contains the data implement the interface
	de.enough.polish.io.Serializable. With this the J2ME Polish build process will generate all
	the code the write the date into a stream.
	</p>
	<p>
	To be exact the methods defined in de.enough.polish.io.Externalizable also are generated by
	the build process and added to the respective classes.
	</p>

	<h2 id="externalizable">de.enough.polish.io.Externalizable</h2>
	<p>
	When you wanna have full control over what is written to the stream you should inherit from the
	interface de.enough.polish.io.Externalizable and implement the methods read() and write() yourself.
	With this you can easily decide yourself which data are written in what format to the stream.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="serializer">de.enough.polish.io.Serializer</h2>
	<p>
	This is the main class for serialization/deserialization. With this class you can read/write objects
	from/to a given stream.
