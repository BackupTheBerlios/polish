<bugs>
	<bug>
		<name>drawRgbOrigin</name>
		<description>The Graphics.drawRGB(..) method does not use a translated origin, 
		 but starts always at the top-left 0,0 origin.
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>
		Use the top-left 0,0 origin for devices with this bug:\n
		//#ifdef polish.Bugs.drawRgbOrigin\n
			x += g.getTranslateX();\n
			y += g.getTranslateY();\n
		//#endif\n
		g.drawRGB( rgbData, offset, scanlength, x, y, width, height, processAlpha);
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>drawRgbNeedsFullBuffer</name>
		<description>The Graphics.drawRGB(..) method does not accept only one row which
		then can be repeated several times. Usually this trick saves some memory as well as work.
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>
		Give a full buffer (rows * columns) in the drawRGB method instead of only one row.
		</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>ImageIOStreamAutoClose</name>
		<description>The Image.createImage( InputStream in ) should not close
		the given input stream according to the specification. Devices with this
		bug close the input stream.
		</description>
		<area>io</area>
		<solution>Move any image which should be loaded from an input stream to 
		the last position in the corresponding stream.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>fullScreenInPaint</name>
		<description>Calling the Canvas.setFullScreenMode(boolean) method results
		in an error, unless it is called in the paint()-method.
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>Track the state of the fullscreen mode and set it in the paint method.
		</solution>
	</bug>
	<bug>
		<name>losesFullScreen</name>
		<description>Canvas.setFullScreenMode(boolean) is needed regularily,
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>Call it in every paint() method.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>fullScreenInShowNotify</name>
		<description>Calling the Canvas.setFullScreenMode(boolean) method results
		in an error, unless it is called in the showNotify()-method.
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>Set it the fullscreen mode in the showNotify() method.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>

		</description>
		<area>game, ui</area>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>DisplayGetColor</name>
		<description>The MIDP/2.0 Display-method getColor( int specification ) does not work
		on this device. This method is often used for CustomItems.
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>Define and use your own colors for this device.
		A possible (but untested) solution might be to call getColor() after the first
		screen has been set, so that the UI graphics system has the chance to initialize.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>needsGCinPaint</name>
		<description>When you encounter a DISCONTINUED error on such a device,
		you might need to call the garbage collection in each paint(Graphics g)-call.
		</description>
		<area>ui</area>
		<solution>Call the Runtime.getRuntime().gc()-method in your paint(Graphics g)-methods.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>inaccessibleFirstRow</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The first top row of pixels is not accsessible for developers. Painting the whole screen with a fullsize image will result in the last row of pixels out of screen. </description>
		<solution></solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>umlautsInSmallFont</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>Some special characters are not displayed correctly in small fonts.</description>
		<solution>Using medium, large or bitmap fonts.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>dateFieldAcceptsNoNullDate</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The javax.microedition.lcdui.DateField must not get a null Date, otherwise it cannot be changed by the user.</description>
		<solution>Provide a new Date instance with the setDate( java.util.Date ) after creating the DateField or use the J2ME Polish GUI.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>dateFieldBroken</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The javax.microedition.lcdui.DateField always returns the initial value, even when the value has been changed by the user.</description>
		<solution>Use the J2ME Polish GUI (which assumes a &quot;true&quot; polish.DateField.directInputMode when this error is present from J2ME Polish 1.3 onwards).</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>layerManagerSetViewWindow</name>
		<area>game</area>
		<description>The setViewWindow( viewX, viewY, viewWidth, viewHeight ) method moves all layers in the manager instead of setting the view window.</description>
		<solution>Don't set the view window's viewX and viewY coordinates  when this bug is present and adjust the paint-call of the layer-manager: 
		 instead of calling layerManager.paint( g, x, y ) call layerManager.paint( g, x - viewX, y - viewY ).
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>needsNokiaUiForSystemAlerts</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>When using the MIDP/2.0 based fullscreen mode devices with this error do not show system screens properly. 
		 System screens are usually shown automatically when security sensitive operations are undertaken,
		 e.g. sending a short message.
		</description>
		<solution>Use the com.nokia.mid.ui.FullCanvas instead for having a fullscreen mode. The J2ME Polish GUI does this automatically when this error is present.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>stringWidthLineBreak</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The Font.stringWidth( String ) method disregards any characters after a line-break character (\n).</description>
		<solution>When calculating the complete width of a string with line-breaks, you need to split the string at the line-breaks first and then add up the widths of the single parts.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>ConnectorNokiaComm</name>
		<area>io</area>
		<description>Infrared ports cannot be opend with Connector.open(&quot;comm:IR0&quot;).</description>

	<bug>
		<name>PlatformRequestHttpLaunchRequiresExit</name>
		<area>io</area>
		<description>Normally a platformRequest( &quot;http://www.xxx.com&quot;) should launch the browser immediately, 
		  with either leaving the application running or destroying the application first. On the affected devices
		  you need to exit the application manually, however. Initialising voice calls via platformRequest() is working
		  however with putting the application to the background.
		</description>
		<solution>Exit the application manually after issuing a HTTP platform request when this bug is present.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>ExitCommandAlwaysPresent</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>On Series 60 phones there is always an &quot;Exit&quot; command present for closing the application.</description>
		<solution>Use the J2ME Polish GUI instead.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>PlatformRequestRequiresQuit</name>
		<area>io</area>
		<description>When a non-voice-call platform request is issued, the application needs to be exited manually before the request is launched.</description>
		<solution>Exit the application when this bug is present.</solution>
	</bug>


	<bug>
		<name>GaugeNoProgessIndicatorOnAlerts</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>When you update a Gauge item within an Alert this update is not shown. Also the title of the Alert is not shown.</description>
		<solution>Do not use a Gauge as a progress indicator in Alerts when this bug is present.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>BluetoothRfcommInputStream</name>
		<area>io</area>
		<description>When an RFCOMM-protocol InputStream is read over a bluetooth connection on the affected devices,
			an IOException is thrown when the the other end has closed the stream while it is still being read.
			Also the application crashes when the input stream uses an array bigger than 512 bytes.
		</description>
		<solution>Make sure that the other end does not close the connection before the application has finished
			reading the input stream. Also do not use a larger array than 512 for the input stream.
		</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>OverrideGetWidthGetHeightInFullCanvas</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>When you extend the com.nokia.mid.ui.FullCanvas class you can experience strange behaviors and crashes 
			when you override either the getWidth() or the getHeight() method. Nokia canvas classes don't seem to
			like that in general.
		</description>
		<solution>Use other method names if you need to provide your own height and width.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>drawStringOver200Chars</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The Graphics.drawString() and Graphics.drawSubstring() methods crash when the given String contains 
			more than 200 characters.
		</description>
		<solution>Use Graphics.drawChars() instead.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>getResourceAsStreamMemoryLeak</name>
		<area>io, ui</area>
		<description>When you call getResourceAsStream() memory will be leaked in the same size as the resource.
		     This is also the case when it is used indirectly, e.g. in Image.createImage().
		</description>
		<solution>
			Don't load the same resource more than once and hope it all fits into the memory.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>setClipForFullScreenNeeded</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>This devices requires that the Graphics clip is set to 
		the full canvas dimensions, otherwise only part of available space can be used.</description>
		<solution>call setClip( ${polish.FullCanvasWidth}, ${polish.FullCanvasHeight }) in each paint() method.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>stringsInOffscreenAlwaysBlack</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>Strings that are drawn in an image-buffer are always black.</description>
		<solution>
			Use a bright background color or paint strings only directly on the Graphics element
			given in the Canvas.paint() method.
		</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>displaySetCurrentFlickers</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>
			Each time when a new screen is shown a white flash is seen. Also when an existing canvas is shown, 
			apparently an internal buffer is shown first before paint() of that canvas is called.
		</description>
		<solution>
			Use the J2ME Polish GUI (in fullscreen mode) or use a single canvas.
		</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>GameCanvasGetGraphicsNotInConstructor</name>
		<area>game</area>
		<description>
			When you get the Graphics instance of a GameCanvas in fullscreen mode, you must not get it in the constructor, 
			because in that case you cannot draw the complete available height.
		</description>
		<solution>
			Retrieve the Graphics object at a later state, e.g. in the game loop.
		</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>ReducedMessageLength</name>
		<area>wmapi</area>
		<description>
			In older firmware versions the length of messages is reduced to 89%, ie if you send 100 chars, 
			it will only send 89, if you send 150 it will send 133.
		</description>
		<solution>
			Set the length of the message to actualLength * 1.123 or arrange for a firmware update.
		</solution>

	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>VersionNumberMustNotExceed99</name>
		<area>build</area>
		<description>Each version number must not exceed 99. The version 1.0.99 is valid, whereas 1.0.100 will not be accepted.</description>
		<solution>Always use lower version numbers than 100.</solution>
	</bug>
        
	<bug>
		<name>getHeightReturnsCompleteScreenHeight</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>canvas.getHeight() always returns the height of the screen, not matter whether the fullscreen mode is activated or not.</description>
		<solution>Call graphics.getClipHeight() instead.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>sizeChangedReportsWrongHeight</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>canvas.sizeChanged(int width, int height) returns the height of the screen in non-fullscreen mode, not matter whether the fullscreen mode is activated or not.</description>
		<solution>Ignore the sizeChanged() call on such devices.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>TransparencyNotWorkingInNokiaUiApi</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>Nokia-UI-API: After creating a transparent image with DirectUtils nothing can be rendered on that image buffer.</description>
		<solution>Use MIDP 2.0 drawRGB instead.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>FillPolygonRequiresPositiveXYInNokiaUiApi</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>Nokia-UI-API: In DirectGraphics.fillPolygon each x and y point needs to be at least 1 or higher, otherwise the rendering is aborted without error message.</description>
		<solution>Use x/y points that are 1 or higher, or use MIDP 2.0 drawRGB instead.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>ItemStateListenerCalledTooEarly</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The item state listener is called too early, e.g. when the user has pressed a key
		             in a TextField without the key being added to the field already. Subsequent calls
		             to textField.getString() will then append the pressed key to the field. This
		             restricts user input to only the first character of a group, e.g. only
		             'a' instead of 'abc2'.
		</description>
		<solution>Use the J2ME Polish GUI and enable the direct input mode for TextFields.
		          Alternatively wait some time before processing the item state event and
		          calling textField.getString().
		</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>noTranslucencyWithDrawRgb</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>Translucency is not supported with Graphics.drawRGB.</description>
		<solution>Use either fully transparent of fully opaque colors.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>usesVideoRam</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>A specialized memory section (the video RAM) is used for storing images. Image data is not necissarily gargbage collected from here and images larger thant the video RAM size might be loadable, but cannot be displayed, since they have to be copied into the video RAM first.</description>
		<solution>Not a bug. Load images that are needed often first.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
		<name>NoPermanentBacklight</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>The backlight cannot be turned on permanently.</description>
		<solution>Run a thread for turning the light on every 60 seconds or so.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>ReservedKeywordSerializable</name>
		<area>io</area>
		<description>Classes called Serializable confuse the device</description>
		<solution>The J2ME polish build process works around this by auto-renaming the de.enough.polish.io.Serializable interface.</solution>
	</bug>

	<bug>
		<name>ignoreTitleCall</name>
		<area>ui</area>
		<description>
		When going into the fullscreen mode, the JVM calls screen.setTitle(null), which prevents
		J2ME Polish to run an application in fullscreen while showing the title.
		</description>
		<solution>Just ignore the scren.setTitle(null) call after entering the fullscreen mode.</solution>
	</bug>
	
	<bug>
