	<bug>
		<name>drawRgbOrigin</name>
		<description>The Graphics.drawRGB(..) method does not use a translated origin, 
		 but starts always at the top-left 0,0 origin.
		</description>
		<solution>
		Use the top-left 0,0 origin for devices with this bug:
		//#ifdef polish.Bugs.drawRgbOrigin
			x += g.getTranslateX();
			y += g.getTranslateY();
		//#endif
		g.drawRGB( rgbData, offset, scanlength, x, y, width, height, processAlpha);
		</solution>
