BUGS

- 050512.01: Folding truncates block directives. E.g. an #endif after the last import statement
  is left after a folding.
 
- 050512.02: marking #else will not mark corresponding #endif if else clause contains nested
  block directives.

- 050512.03: menuitems source, refactor ... are missing. Also some buttons like next annotation.

- 050512.04: Always inserting //#endif after //#if is annoying.
