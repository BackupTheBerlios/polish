BUGS

- 050512.01: Folding truncates block directives. E.g. an #endif after the last import statement
  is left after a folding.
 
- 050512.02: marking '#else' will not mark corresponding '#endif' if else clause contains nested
  block directives.

- 050512.03: menuitems source, refactor ... are missing. Also some buttons like next annotation.

- 050512.04: Always inserting //#endif after //#if is annoying. Also always left shifting. Solution:
    search for corresponding block elements and indent current element only when they are presend.

- 050517.01: After pasting preprocessor directive the //# is split up to (start of line)//    #def

- 050523.01: mark occurrences does not remove previous java marks.

- 050523.02: mark occurrences is not shutting down marks when the toggle button is pressed.
