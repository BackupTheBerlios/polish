Problems:

The folding mechanism can divide block directives.


Coding:

Big Problem: We need to register our own partitioner. Every class in jdt uses
JavaPlugin.getJavaTextTools().getPartitioner(). How do we subclass JavaTextTools and register it
with the JavaPlugin?? When we subclass, the new object must be registered with the remaining classes. But
they can only be tuned by subclassing.

One solution: simply use the singleLineScanner and reimplement it... But that will not do the trick because
others use JavaTextTools.getSingleLineScanner()... AND setJavaSourceViewerConfiguration() must be called
somewhere. But where?
