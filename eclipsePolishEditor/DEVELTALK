Problems:

The folding mechanism can divide block directives.


Decision of design

syntax highlighting: overload the getSingleLineCommentScanner from JavaSourceViewerConfiguration.
Having a own partition is difficult because it would overlap with content type SINGLE_LINE_COMMENT.
Alternative: overload FastJavaPartitionScanner and return new content type for //#. Problems: Use of partitions is
hardwired everywhere in the jdt
