/**
 *
 * This class provides an abstraction for platform-independent Font objects.
 * 
 /**
 * The <code>Font</code> class represents fonts and font
 * metrics. <code>Fonts</code> cannot be
 * created by applications. Instead, applications query for fonts
 * based on
 * font attributes and the system will attempt to provide a font that
 * matches
 * the requested attributes as closely as possible.
 *
 * <p> A <code>Font's</code> attributes are style, size, and face. Values for
 * attributes must be specified in terms of symbolic constants. Values for
 * the style attribute may be combined using the bit-wise
 * <code>OR</code> operator,
 * whereas values for the other attributes may not be combined. For example,
 * the value </p>
 *
 * <p> <code>
 * STYLE_BOLD | STYLE_ITALIC
 * </code> </p>
 *
 * <p> may be used to specify a bold-italic font; however </p>
 *
 * <p> <code>
 * SIZE_LARGE | SIZE_SMALL
 * </code> </p>
 *
 * <p> is illegal. </p>
 *
 * <p> The values of these constants are arranged so that zero is valid for
 * each attribute and can be used to specify a reasonable default font
 * for the system. For clarity of programming, the following symbolic
 * constants are provided and are defined to have values of zero: </p>
 *
 * <p> <ul>
 * <li> <code> STYLE_PLAIN </code> </li>
 * <li> <code> SIZE_MEDIUM </code> </li>
 * <li> <code> FACE_SYSTEM </code> </li>
 * </ul> </p>
 *
 * <p> Values for other attributes are arranged to have disjoint bit patterns
 * in order to raise errors if they are inadvertently misused (for example,
 * using <code>FACE_PROPORTIONAL</code> where a style is
 * required). However, the values
 * for the different attributes are not intended to be combined with each
 * other. </p>
